# Homework 5 - CSE 320 - Fall 2023
#### Professor Eugene Stark

### **Due Date: Friday 12/08/2023 @ 11:59pm**

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with low-level POSIX
threads, multi-threading safety, concurrency guarantees, and networking.
The overall objective is to implement a simple multi-threaded
transactional object store.  As you will probably find this somewhat
difficult, to grease the way we have provided you with a design for the server,
as well as binary object files for almost all the modules.  This means that you
can build a functioning server without initially facing too much
complexity.  In each step of the assignment, you will replace one of our
binary modules with one built from your own source code.  If you succeed
in replacing all of our modules, you will have completed your own
version of the server.

It is probably best if you work on the modules in roughly the order
indicated below.  Turn in as many modules as you have been able to finish
and have confidence in.  Don't submit incomplete modules or modules
that don't function at some level, as these will negatively impact
the ability of the code to be compiled or to pass tests.

### Takeaways

After completing this homework, you should:

* Have a basic understanding of socket programming
* Understand thread execution, locks, and semaphores
* Have an advanced understanding of POSIX threads
* Have some insight into the design of concurrent data structures
* Have enhanced your C programming abilities

## Hints and Tips

* We strongly recommend you check the return codes of all system
  calls. This will help you catch errors.

* **BEAT UP YOUR OWN CODE!** Throw lots of concurrent calls at your
  data structure libraries to ensure safety.

* Your code should **NEVER** crash. We will be deducting points for
  each time your program crashes during grading. Make sure your code
  handles invalid usage gracefully.

* You should make use of the macros in `debug.h`. You would never
  expect a library to print arbitrary statements as it could interfere
  with the program using the library. **FOLLOW THIS CONVENTION!**
  `make debug` is your friend.

## Helpful Resources

### Textbook Readings

You should make sure that you understand the material covered in
chapters **11.4** and **12** of **Computer Systems: A Programmer's
Perspective (3rd Edition)** before starting this assignment.  These
chapters cover networking and concurrency in great detail and will be
an invaluable resource for this assignment.

### pthread Man Pages

The pthread man pages can be easily accessed through your terminal.
However, [this opengroup.org site](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/pthread.h.html)
provides a list of all the available functions.  The same list is also
available for [semaphores](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/semaphore.h.html).

## Getting Started

Fetch and merge the base code for `hw5` as described in `hw0`. You can
find it at this link: https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse320/hw5.
Remember to use the `--stategy-option=theirs` flag for the `git merge`
command to avoid merge conflicts in the Gitlab CI file.

## The Xacto Server and Protocol: Overview

The "Xacto" server implements a simple transactional object store,
designed for use in a network environment.  For the purposes of this
assignment, an object store is essentially a hash map that maps
**keys** to **values**, where both keys and values can be arbitrary data.
There are two basic operations on the store: `PUT` and `GET`.
As you might expect, the `PUT` operation associates a key with a value,
and the `GET` operation retrieves the value associated with a key.
Although values may be null, keys may not.  The null value is used as
the default value associated with a key if no `PUT` has been performed
on that key.

A client wishing to make use of the object store first makes a network
connection to the server.  Upon connection, a **transaction** is
created by the server.  All operations that the client performs during
this session will execute in the scope of that transaction.
The client issues a series of `PUT` and `GET` requests to the server,
receiving a response from each one.  Upon completing the series of
requests, the client issues a `COMMIT` request.  If all is well, the
transaction **commits** and its effects on the store are made permanent.
Due to interference of transactions being executed concurrently by
other clients, however, it is possible for a transaction to **abort**
rather than committing.  The effects of an aborted transaction are
erased from the store and it is as if the transaction had never happened.
A transaction may abort at any time up until it has successfully committed;
in particular the response from any `PUT` or `GET` request might
indicate that the transaction has aborted.  When a transaction has
aborted, the server closes the client connection.  The client may
then open a new connection and retry the operations in the context of
a new transaction.

The Xacto server architecture is that of a multi-threaded network
server.  When the server is started, a **master** thread sets up a
socket on which to listen for connections from clients.  When a
connection is accepted, a **client service thread** is started to
handle requests sent by the client over that connection.  The client
service thread executes a service loop in which it repeatedly receives
a **request packet** sent by the client, performs the request, and
sends a **reply** packet that indicates the result.
Besides request and reply packets, there are also **data** packets
that are used to send key and value data between the client and
server.

### The Base Code

Here is the structure of the base code:

```
.
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
└── hw5
    ├── include
    │   ├── client_registry.h
    │   ├── data.h
    │   ├── debug.h
    │   ├── protocol.h
    │   ├── server.h
    │   ├── store.h
    │   └── transaction.h
    ├── lib
    │   ├── xacto.a
    │   └── xacto_debug.a
    ├── Makefile
    ├── src
    │   └── main.c
    ├── tests
    │   └── xacto_tests.c
    └── util
        └── client
```

The base code consists of header files that define module interfaces,
a library `xacto.a` containing binary object code for our
implementations of the modules, and a source code file `main.c` that
contains containing a stub for function `main()`.  The `Makefile` is
designed to compile any existing source code files and then link them
against the provided library.  The result is that any modules for
which you provide source code will be included in the final
executable, but modules for which no source code is provided will be
pulled in from the library.

The `util` directory contains an executable for a simple test client.
When you run this program it will print a help message that
summarizes the commands.  The client program understands command-line
options `-h <hostname>`, `-p <port>`, and `-q`.  The `-p` option is
required; the others are optional.  The `-q` flag tells the client to
run without prompting; this is useful if you want to run the client
with the standard input redirected from a file.

## Task I: Server Initialization

When the base code is compiled and run, it will print out a message
saying that the server will not function until `main()` is
implemented.  This is your first task.  The `main()` function will
need to do the following things:

- Obtain the port number to be used by the server from the command-line
  arguments.  The port number is to be supplied by the required option
  `-p <port>`.
  
- Install a `SIGHUP` handler so that clean termination of the server can
  be achieved by sending it a `SIGHUP`.  Note that you need to use
  `sigaction()` rather than `signal()`, as the behavior of the latter is
  not well-defined in a multithreaded context.

- Set up the server socket and enter a loop to accept connections
  on this socket.  For each connection, a thread should be started to
  run function `xacto_client_service()`.

These things should be relatively straightforward to accomplish, given the
information presented in class and in the textbook.  If you do them properly,
the server should function and accept connections on the specified port,
and you should be able to connect to the server using the test client.
Note that if you build the server using `make debug`, then the binaries
we have supplied will produce a fairly extensive debugging trace of what
they are doing.  This, together with the specifications in this document
and in the header files, will likely be invaluable to you in understanding
the desired behavior of the various modules.

## Task II: Send and Receive Functions

The header file `include/protocol.h` defines the format of the packets
used in the Xacto network protocol.  The concept of a protocol is an
important one to understand.  A protocol creates a standard for
communication so that any program implementing a protocol will be able
to connect and operate with any other program implementing the same
protocol.  Any client should work with any server if they both
implement the same protocol correctly.  In the Xacto protocol,
clients and servers exchange **packets** with each other.  Each packet
has two parts: a fixed-size **header** that describes the packet, and an
optional **payload** that can carry arbitrary data.  The fixed-size
header of a packet always has the same size and format, which is given
by the `XACTO_PACKET` structure; however the payload can be of arbitrary
size.  One of the fields in the header tells how long the payload is.

- The function `proto_send_packet()` is used to send a packet over a
network connection.  The `fd` argument is the file descriptor of a
socket over which the packet is to be sent.  The `pkt` argument is a
pointer to the packet header.  The `data` argument is a
pointer to the data payload, if there is one, otherwise it is `NULL`.
The `proto_send_packet` assumes that multi-byte fields in the packet
passed to it are in **network byte order**.
This means that when multibyte fields in the packet header are set,
the values being stored in them must be converted from the normal
host byte order to network byte order.  The `write()` system call is
then used to write the header to the "wire" (i.e. the network connection).
If the length field of the header specifies a nonzero payload length,
then an additional `write()` call is used to write the payload data
to the wire.

> :nerd: Normally, multi-byte values are stored in memory according to
> **host byte order**, which varies between architectures.
> For example, Intel-based platforms use "little-endian" byte order,
> which stores the least-significant byte of a multibyte quantity in the

> byte order, which is the opposite.
> In order for hosts with different "endianness" to be able to understand
> each other, multi-byte quantities in fields of packets sent over the

> order before sending, and they are converted back to host byte order
> upon reception.
> Conversion between host and network byte order can be done using, e.g.,
> the `htonl()` and related functions described in the Linux man pages.

- The function `proto_recv_packet()` reverses the procedure in order to
receive a packet.  It first uses the `read()` system call to read a
fixed-size packet header from the wire.  If the length field of the header
is nonzero then an additional `read()` is used to read the payload from
the wire.  The header and payload are stored using pointers supplied
by the caller.  Multi-byte values in the packet header returned by the
`proto_recv_packet()` are stored in network byte order.

**NOTE:** Remember that it is always possible for `read()` and `write()`
to read or write fewer bytes than requested.  You must check for and
handle these "short count" situations.

Implement these functions in a file `protocol.c`.  If you do it
correctly, the server should function as before.

## Task III: Client Registry

You probably noticed the initialization of the `client_registry`
variable in `main()` and the use of the `creg_wait_for_empty()`
function in `terminate()`.  The client registry provides a way of
keeping track of the number of client connections that currently exist,
and to allow a "master" thread to forcibly shut down all of the
connections and to await the termination of all server threads
before finally terminating itself.

The functions provided by a client registry are specified in the
`client_registry.h` header file.  Provide implementations for these
functions in a file `src/client_registry.c`.  Note that these functions
need to be thread-safe, so synchronization will be required.  Use a
mutex to protect access to the thread counter data.  Use a semaphore
to perform the required blocking in the `creg_wait_for_empty()`
function.  To shut down a client connection, use the `shutdown()`
function described in Section 2 of the Linux manual pages.
You may assume that any file descriptors managed by the client registry
have a value less than the constant `FD_SETSIZE` defined in the header
file `<sys/select.h>` (see the man page for `select(2)`).

Implementing the client registry should be a fairly easy warm-up
exercise in concurrent programming.  If you do it correctly, the
Xacto server should still shut down cleanly in response to SIGHUP
using your version.

**Note:** You should test your client registry separately from the
server.  Create test threads that rapidly call `creg_register()` and
`creg_unregister()` methods concurrently and then check that a call to the
`creg_wait_for_empty()` function blocks until the number of registered
clients reaches zero, and then returns.

## Task IV: Data Module

The file `data.h` describes **blobs**, which represent reference-counted
chunks of arbitrary data, **keys**, which are blobs packaged together
with a hash code so that they can be used as keys in a hash table,
and **versions**, which are used to represent versions of data in the
transactional store.

A possibly unfamiliar (but essential) concept here is the notion of a
**reference count**.
The basic idea of reference counting is for an object to maintain
a field that counts the total number of pointers to it that exist.
Each time a pointer is created (or copied) the reference count is
increased.  Each time a pointer is discarded, the reference count
is decreased.  When the reference count reaches zero, there are
no outstanding pointers to the object and it can be freed.
The reason we need to use reference counting for various objects
is because pointers to those objects can be stored in other objects,
where they can persist long after the original context in which
they were created has terminated.  Eventually, we need to be able to
determine when the last pointer to an object has been discarded,
so that we can free the object and not leak storage.

In a reference counting scheme, the object to which reference counting
is to be applied has to provide two functions: one for increasing
the reference count and another for decreasing it.  The function
for decreasing the reference count has the responsibility of
freeing the object when the reference count reaches zero.
In addition, the code that uses a reference-counted object has
to be carefully written so that whenever a pointer is created
the method to increase the reference count is called, and whenever
a pointer is discarded the method to decrease the reference count
is called.

When specifying and implementing functions that work on
reference-counted objects, it is important to have a clear idea
of exactly when reference counts need to be increased, decreased,
or left alone.
If a function that receives a reference-counted object passed as
a parameter needs to save a pointer to that object somewhere,
in general it will need to increase the reference count to account
for the additional pointer.
The caller is then free to continue to use its own pointer to the
object after the function has been called.

On the other hand, in some cases, the caller does not need to use
its pointer again once it has been passed to a function.
We can then think of the caller transferring "ownership" of its pointer
to the called function, which "consumes" the reference it is passed.
If a caller's reference is consumed by a function, then the caller must
not use that pointer again.  Judicious use of the concept of consuming
a reference can reduce the number of situations in which a reference count
is increased, only to be immediately decreased.
However, it is important that the specification of a function clearly
indicate whether the function is inheriting a reference or whether it must
increase the reference count if it wants to retain a copy of that pointer.

A related piece of terminology we will use in conjunction with
non-reference-counted objects is the concept of a function "inheriting"
a pointer from its caller.  In this case, the caller transfers
to the called function the responsibility for ultimately freeing the
pointer.  When a called function inherits a pointer from its caller,
the caller must not use the pointer again after the call.

With the above information in mind, the implementation of this module
should be relatively straightforward.
Note that, in a multi-threaded setting, reference counts are shared
between threads and therefore need to be protected by mutexes if
they are to work reliably.

## Task V: Client Service Thread

Next, you should implement the thread function that performs service
for a client.  This function is called `xacto_client_service`, and
you should implement it in the `src/server.c` file.

The `xacto_client_service` function is invoked as the thread function
for a thread that is created to service a client connection.
The argument is a pointer to the integer file descriptor to be used
to communicate with the client.  Once this file descriptor has been
retrieved, the storage it occupied needs to be freed.
The thread must then become detached, so that it does not have to be
explicitly reaped, and it must register the client file descriptor with
the client registry.  Next, a transaction should be created to be used
as the context for carrying out client requests.
Finally, the thread should enter a service loop in which it repeatedly
receives a request packet sent by the client, carries out the request,
and sends a reply packet, followed (in the case of a reply to a `GET` request)
by a data packet that contains the result.  If as a result of carrying
out any of the requests, the transaction commits or aborts, then
(after sending the required reply to the current request) the service
loop should end and the client service thread terminate, closing the
client connection.

## Task VI: Transaction Manager

Probably the next easiest module to implement is the transaction manager,
which is responsible for creating, committing, and aborting transactions.
The various functions that have to be implemented are specified in
`transaction.h` header file.

For transactions, the function `trans_ref()` is used to increase
the reference count on a transaction and the function `trans_unref()`
is used to decrease the reference count.  The reference count itself is
maintained in the `refcnt` field of the `transaction` structure.
Because it is accessed concurrently, it needs to be protected by a mutex.
When transaction is created by the client service thread, it initially
has a reference count of one.
The transaction gets passed to various other functions, including operations
on the store.  If the store needs to save a reference to a transaction
(*e.g.* to record the transaction as the "creator" of a version of
some data), then it will increase the reference count before doing so
to account for the saved pointer.
Ultimately, the transaction will be committed via a call to
`trans_commit` or aborted via a call to `trans_abort`.
These two calls consume a reference to the transaction
(*i.e.* they decrement the reference count), so the caller should not
continue to use the transaction subsequently unless an additional
reference was previously created.

A transaction is only ever committed by a call to `trans_commit` made
by the client service thread in response to a `COMMIT` request received
from the client.  Once `trans_commit` has been called, it could be
that the last reference to the transaction has been consumed and
the transaction has been freed, so the transaction object should not
referenced again after that (unless another reference has previously
been obtained).
Calls to operations on the store may cause a transaction to abort,
but in that case they arrange to increase the reference count before doing
so, so that the net value of the reference count will not be decreased
and client service thread will be able to check the status of a
transaction after performing a store operation to see whether or not
the transaction has aborted.

One other complication in the implementation of transactions is
the notion of "dependency".  As a result of performing an operation on
the store, a transaction may become **dependent** on one or more other
transactions.  Before a transaction may commit, it must wait for all
the transactions on which it depends (*i.e.* the transactions in its
**dependency set**) to commit.  If any of the transactions in the dependency
set aborts, then the transaction itself must abort.
In order to manage dependencies, the transaction manager module provides
a function `trans_add_dependency`, which is used to add one transaction
(the "dependee") to the dependency set of another (the "dependent").
Adding a dependency is done by allocating a "dependency" structure,
storing a reference to the dependee transaction in that structure,
and adding the structure to the linked list of dependencies for the dependent
transaction, after checking to make sure that there is not already an entry
for the same dependee in the dependency list.  The reference count of the
dependee transaction must increased to account for the stored pointer.

When a transaction attempts to commit, it must first call `sem_wait`
on the semaphore in the `sem` field of each of the transactions in its
dependency set.  This will block the transaction until the transaction
on which it depends has committed and done `sem_post` on that semaphore.
Since a transaction can exist in the dependency set of more than one
other transaction, in order to know how many times to call `sem_post`
it has to rely on the transaction calling `sem_wait` to have first
incremented the `waitcnt` field on the transaction for which it is
waiting, so that `waitcnt` always correctly reflects the number of
transactions waiting on `sem_wait`.  Of course, the `waitcnt` field
of a transaction must only be accessed while the mutex lock on that
transaction is held.

Once `sem_wait` has been called on all transactions in the dependency
set, a transaction can check the status of these transactions to see
if any have aborted.  If so, then committing is not possible, and the
dependent transaction must abort instead.  If all of the dependee
transactions have committed, then the dependent transaction can move
to the "committed" state.

## Task VII: Transactional Store

If you have made it this far, then you can try to implement the
transactional store module itself.  This is probably the most technical
of the various modules, so you probably need to have a good understanding
of what is going on before you attempt the implementation.
The functions for the store are specified in the `store.h` header
file, where some further details of how the store works are given.
Besides the fairly straightforward initialization and finalization
functions, the store provides functions `store_put` and `store_get`,
which in the end are rather similar to each other.
Each function uses the hash code of the key passed as argument
to identify a particular "bucket" in the hash table.
The bucket is then searched to find a map entry whose key is equal
to the given key.  If an entry is not found, one is created and
inserted into the proper bucket.

Once the map entry for the given key has been located (or created),
then both `store_put` and `store_get` work by inserting a new
"version" into the list of versions contained in that map entry.
The concept of a version, and the rules by which version lists
are maintained, are detailed in `store.h`.
As a result of these rules, it is possible for a transaction calling
`store_put` or `store_get` to either abort or become dependent
on other transactions.  The implementations of these functions have
to arrange for these actions to be carried out when necessary.

Note that the only time versions are removed from the transactional
store is during the "garbage collection" phase carried out at the
beginning of a `store_put` or `store_get` operation.
Upon completion of an operation, there will in general be "extra"
versions in the store that will get cleaned up on the next call
to `store_put` or `store_get`.  You will want to be careful to
manage the reference counts on the various objects so that you
don't end up with any blobs or transactions that hang around
forever, even when they are not reachable from anything in the store,
and that you don't attempt to decrease any reference count below
zero.  If you do this all correctly, then when the server terminates
(as a result of `SIGHUP`), all objects will be cleanly freed.

## Submission Instructions

Make sure your hw5 directory looks similarly to the way it did
initially and that your homework compiles (be sure to try compiling
both with and without "debug").
Note that you should omit any source files for modules that you did not
complete, and that you might have some source and header files in addition
to those shown.  You are also, of course, encouraged to create Criterion
tests for your code.
The test file we have provided contains some code to start a server and
attempt to connect to it.  It will probably be useful while you are
working on `main.c`.

It would definitely be a good idea to use `valgrind` to check your program
for memory and file descriptor leaks.  Keeping track of allocated objects
and making sure to free them is one of the more challenging aspects of this
assignment.

To submit, run `git submit hw5`.
